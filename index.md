# hello adventurer. welcome to smart contract dev quest


### how to play
- go to each NPC (non-player contract)  
- do whatever you can to get cool NFTs.
- set your own rules. play it anyway you like.
  - Veni, vidi, vici : only look at NPCs code. 
  - Open World: check out others player transaction or any external information are cool here.
  - Party Mode: work with friend. learn together. (pls don't share seed phase)
  - [never give up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) : only attempt one quest at a time.  
  - [I want it that way!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fndeDfaWCg) : yeah just the way you like it!
